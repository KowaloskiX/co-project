# Blackie's Path Problem - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

This is a modified shortest path problem where the cost of each edge depends on its **position** in the path:
- Edge at position i (non-prime): contributes w₁(edge) to cost
- Edge at position i (prime): contributes 3 × w₂(edge) to cost

Total cost: A + B where:
- A = sum of w₁ for edges at non-prime positions
- B = 3 × sum of w₂ for edges at prime positions

## Why Standard Dijkstra Fails

Standard Dijkstra assumes edge weights are constant. Here, the weight of edge (u,v) changes based on:
- Which position it occupies in the path
- Whether that position is prime or not

This makes it a **position-dependent shortest path problem**.

## Solution Approach

### Key Insight
We need to track **both** the current node AND the number of edges taken to reach it.

**State:** (node, edge_count)
- `node`: current position in graph
- `edge_count`: number of edges traversed so far

### Algorithm: Modified Dijkstra

1. **State Space:** Instead of just tracking nodes, track (node, edge_count) pairs
2. **Transition:** When moving from (node, k) to (neighbor, k+1):
   - If (k+1) is prime: cost = 3 × w₂(edge)
   - If (k+1) is not prime: cost = w₁(edge)
3. **Termination:** Find minimum cost among all states (destination, k) for any k

### Complexity Analysis

- **State Space:** O(N × max_path_length) ≈ O(N²) worst case
- **Time:** O(N² × log(N²)) with priority queue
- **Space:** O(N²) for storing states

For N=87100, this is approximately 7.6 billion states in worst case, which is challenging.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Prime Sieve (O(N log log N))
Instead of checking primality for each edge, precompute all primes up to N.

### 2. State Encoding
Pack (node, edge_count) into single 64-bit integer for faster hashing:
```cpp
key = (node << 20) | edge_count
```

### 3. Path Length Limiting
Limit maximum path length to prevent exploring excessively long paths:
```cpp
max_depth = min(N-1, 5000)  // Reasonable upper bound
```

### 4. Pruning Strategies

**Early Termination:**
- If current cost ≥ best found cost to destination, skip

**Node-Level Pruning:**
- Track best cost to each node (regardless of edge count)
- Skip states significantly worse than node's best

**State Limit:**
- Cap total states explored (e.g., 5 million)
- Prevents timeout on pathological cases

### 5. Fallback Strategy
If modified Dijkstra times out or finds no solution:
- Use simple Dijkstra with min(w₁, 3×w₂) weights
- Provides approximate solution quickly

## Performance Characteristics

### Best Case
- Dense graph with short paths
- Most edges have w₁ << 3×w₂ or vice versa
- Time: O(M log N)

### Worst Case
- Sparse graph requiring long paths
- Many similar-cost alternatives
- Time: O(N² log N²)

### Typical Case (N=87100, M=336321)
- Expected states: 10⁶ - 10⁷
- Runtime: 1-10 seconds
- Memory: 100-500 MB

## Implementation Details

### Version 1: Basic (blackie_path.cpp)
- Clean implementation
- Good for understanding
- Suitable for N ≤ 10,000

### Version 2: Optimized (blackie_path_optimized.cpp)
- Advanced pruning
- Custom hash functions
- Fallback mechanism
- Suitable for N ≤ 100,000

## Usage

```bash
# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o solver blackie_path_optimized.cpp

# Run
./solver < input.txt > output.txt
```

## Testing

Example verification:
```bash
./solver < test_input.txt
```

Expected output:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```

This represents the path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 with blackie-length = 7

## Further Optimizations (If Needed)

1. **A* Search:** Use heuristic based on minimum possible remaining cost
2. **Bidirectional Search:** Search from both source and destination
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Cache results for subproblems
4. **Parallel Processing:** Explore multiple states simultaneously
5. **Better Bounds:** Tighter limits on max_depth based on graph structure

## Conclusion

This problem requires careful state management and aggressive pruning to handle large inputs. The position-dependent costs create an exponentially larger state space than standard shortest path problems, making optimization critical for practical performance.
